1. Node position fixup at start of loop (before update) (enable only when crowd does not control agents directly)
2. Fix agent states before update (need setting for that, disable by default)
3. Implement signal notification of nodes about their state, position, velocity
4. Implement agent parameters setting
5. bind agent state constants and allow checking agent state
6. Implement physics motion.
7. Implement area tagging
8. Implement tiled mesh and obstacles.
